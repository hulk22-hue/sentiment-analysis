# Sentiment Analysis with RNNs

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the IMDb dataset and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to download data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The performance of each model (SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU) is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and ROC-AUC
